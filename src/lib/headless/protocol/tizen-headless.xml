	Create a wl_buffer object from the pool.

	The buffer is created offset bytes into the pool and has
	width and height as specified.  The stride arguments specifies
	the number of bytes from beginning of one row to the beginning
	of the next.  The format is the pixel format of the buffer and
	must be one of those advertised through the wl_shm.format event.

	A buffer will keep a reference to the pool it was created from
	so it is valid to destroy the pool immediately after creating
	a buffer from it.
